# command_line_app_math

Create a new project in IntelliJ with a Main class with a main method

Run the main method and then edit the run configuration to add an arguments which is a math statement (e.g. 2 + 3)

In a for loop print process the arguments by writing the code to add, substract, muliply and divide. For now just process from left to right (i.e. do not try to figure out order of precedent)
